x = 100
y = 20

# Part A
if x / y == 5:
    print("x divided by y is 5")
    x = 1
else:
    print("are the variables set up correctly?")

# Part B
if x * y == y:
    print("now x times y is y")
    x = 10
else:
    print(f"Whoops, x equals {x}")

# Part C
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
    x = x * 2
else:
    print("uh oh, x is not less than y")

# Part D
if x > y:
    print("how is x greater than y??")
else:
    print("x is NOT greater than y")

# Part E
print(f"The final value of x is {x} and the final value of y is {y}")
